    "     - Typically requires a long-term commitment to a specific server configuration.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting:**\n",
    "     - Highly flexible, with the ability to easily adjust resources and configurations.\n",
    "     - Supports a wide range of applications and services, often with minimal changes needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Security**\n",
    "   - **Traditional Web Hosting:**\n",
    "     - Security is often managed by the hosting provider, but the level of security can vary.\n",
    "     - Dedicated hosting provides more control over security configurations.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting:**\n",
    "     - Cloud providers offer robust security measures, including data encryption, firewalls, and compliance with various standards.\n",
    "     - Shared responsibility model, where the provider secures the infrastructure and the user secures the applications and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**\n",
    "   - **Traditional Web Hosting:**\n",
    "     - Backup and disaster recovery depend on the hosting provider and the plan chosen.\n",
    "     - Often requires manual configuration and management.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting:**\n",
    "     - Typically includes automated backup and disaster recovery solutions.\n",
    "     - Easier to implement geographically distributed backups for enhanced data protection.\n",
    "\n",
